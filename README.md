# GoldyGopher

## Overview

This is a web application that allows the user to input numerical upper and lower bounds, and then outputs all numbers within those bounds--except multiples of 3 are replaced with "Goldy," multiples of 7 are replaced with "Gopher," and multiples of both 7 and 3 (aka multiples of 21) are replaced with "Goldy Gopher."

## How to Run

The application is written in vanilla Javascript, so there are no dependencies and you can run it in any browser with JS enabled. Clone the repository, and open the **index.html** file in a web browser of your choice.

## To Do

The web UI is using default styles for input, button, and paragraph elements. Next steps would be to source a styles file into **index.html** and give those elements a visually appealing look.
